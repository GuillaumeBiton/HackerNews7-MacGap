HackerNews7
===========

Another Hacker News Reader powered by [Framework7](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7)

About
-----
This is a demo app to show how [Framework7](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7) makes it easy to develop hybrid apps.

It is based on the [Official Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) even if I think that the [Unofficial Hacker News API](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi/) provides a better structure (but I hope they will be inspired by this last one).

Some of my work here are inspired by the work of Lim Chee Aun ([cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun)) and is project [hackerweb](https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb)

This app is *multi-platform*. You can use it throw your web browser on your smartphone, tablet or desktop because it's responsive. You can also create a desktop app with [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).
